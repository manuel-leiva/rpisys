+SSH can be enabled by placing a file named ssh, without any extension,
+onto the boot partition of the SD card. When the Pi boots,
+it looks for the  ssh file. If it is found, SSH is enabled,
+and the file is deleted. The content of the file does not matter:
+it could contain text, or nothing at all.
